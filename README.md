# **Scandinavia Front-End Test**

At first, I hope you are doing well.

This test is to preview the clean code and how useful you will be to our team.

The test will be about a simple **crud operations** on a **todos list**, the application contains home page that contains the main todos list we want and another page to show a single todo.

[the design](https://www.figma.com/file/mtltCozpNqhL7x3lBv5uGq/%E2%9C%85--To-Do-List-(Community)?node-id=2%3A490)

## **_Describe The App_**

- You should be able to drag and drop a task from a column to another, and thats will change it's status.
- Clicking the three-dots on any task bring the actions menu that include these two options: edit and delete.
- After clicking on edit action, it will bring an edit module that give the user accessability to edit the task title & description.
- Also, it should be clear that clicking on delete option will delete the task permanently.
- Clicking on a task title will navigate you to the detailed page of this task, you should insure the title of the task is a hyperlink.

## **_The Rules_**

- Create this application using `ReactJs` and `NextJs`.
- Link the application to a public repository on github.
- Organize your repository commits, pushes and branches because it all maters, so organize your work on the git.
- `Axios`, `React Query` and `Material UI` is required libraries to use and any other libraries is optional.
- Every page should have at least `title` and `description` meta tags for better SEO.
- Build the same UI showed in the design link by following the same design system.
- Any action performed in the application (create todo, update todo, ...) need to be synced with the backend.

## **_The API_**

Here we describe the **_API_** that you should communicate with to achieve the goal of the test.

**IMPORTANT**: for each request, you should send a query param `key` and you'll receive its value in your test email.

**IMPORTANT**: The base url for the backend is <https://front-end-todo-test.herokuapp.com>, so list todos link will be like <https://front-end-todo-test.herokuapp.com/todos> and so on.

- list the todos

  ```
  GET: /todo
  ```

  the result:

  ```ts
  type ListTodoResponse = {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    subject: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  }[];
  ```

  ---
- create a todo

  ```
  POST: /todo
  ```

  you should send the new todo in the request body:

  ```ts
  type CreateTodoDto = {
    title: string;
    subject: string;
  };
  ```

  the result is the new todo:

  ```ts
  type CreateTodoResponse = {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    subject: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  };
  ```

  ---
- get a todo

  ```
  GET: /todo/:id
  ```

  you should pass the id of the todo that you want to get in the request query params.

  the result is the requested todo:

  ```ts
  type GetTodoResponse = {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    subject: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  };
  ```

  ---
- update a todo

  ```
  PATCH: /todo/:id
  ```

  you should pass the id of the todo that you want to update in the request query params.

  and you should send the updated todo in the request body:

  ```ts
  type UpdateTodoDto = {
    title?: string;
    subject?: string;
    status?: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  };
  ```

  the result is the updated todo:

  ```ts
  type UpdateTodoResponse = {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    subject: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  };
  ```

  ---
- delete a todo

  ```
  DELETE: /todo:id
  ```

  you should pass the id of the todo that you want to delete in the request query params.

  the result is the deleted todo:

  ```ts
  type DeleteTodoResponse = {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    subject: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done' | 'archive';
  };
  ```

## **_The Point System_**

1. Every break rule will reduce you test points
2. The application contains two pages:
   1. `/`: The homepage.
   2. `/todos/[id]`: Task details.
3. Every change in application design not matching the base design will cost you test points.
4. Every change in application design that make the page better will grant you extra test points.
